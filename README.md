TwinCAT ADS server for Node.js (unofficial). Listens for incoming ADS protocol commands and responds.

If you need an ADS client for reading/writing PLC values, see my other project [ads-client](https://github.com/jisotalo/ads-server).


# Project status

Currently in testing. Readme isn't ready.

# NOTE

This is my first project with Typescript, so it probably includes lot's of things to be done differently.

# How to use

Coming up soon.
